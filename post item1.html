            <p>We cannot teach  anything if we don't have someone's attention or learn anything without paying attention to what is said.
				Hence through attention , information from outside is conveyed inside and vice, versa</p>
            <p>Through using attention the grown-ups who take care of us when we are minors teach us how to create an entire reality in our mind with the use of symbols.
				If we observe children who are 1-4 years, we can see the effort they making to learn an entire symbology.</p>
			<p>The truth is that all of our knowledge we acquired through assimilation and agreement is  nothing more than symbolism or words that we invent for the need to understand and express what we perceive,.
				Every word in our mind and on this page is just a symbol</p>
			<p>We use everything we know which is nothing but symbology to justify  what we believe, to try to explain first to ourselves then to everybody around us the way we perceive ourselves and the entire universe. 
				If we aware of this then its easy to know that all the different mythologies , religions, and philosophies around us , all the different beliefs and ways of thinking are nothing but agreements with ourselves and with other humans. they are our creations , but the real question are they true?</p>
