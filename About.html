              <p>Becoming Uncommon</p>
            </div>
            <p>I am a small girl from a small town called Randburg in the city of Johannesburg,South Africa.I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor's degree on a little island in the Indian ocean called Mauritius. </p>
			<p>I've decided to pursue the degree after I tried to pursue an Accounting Degree for three years , and came to the realisation that the degree didn't suit my personal traits. It was a degree I had chosen because I was convinced I'd be good at it because of my good skills in mathematics.</p>
			<p>Im mentioning the above to highlight that by undertaking the journey to transformation, I was able to unmask what I truly  desire and not what people thought I'd be good at and furthermore channelled my energy into achieving it.</p>
			<p>My journey of transformation embarked after I encountered a huge conflict with my first lover.I am a Survivor of domestic violence and gender based violence.
			<p>Through my adversities I got my enlightenment. I was able to cultivate my conciousness, gain wisdom and  reach my desires. </p>
			<p>With this Blog I aim to share my enlightenment , and help you uncover the true you , so you able to reach and utilize your fullest potential.</p>
