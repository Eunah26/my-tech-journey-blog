              <p>Becoming Uncommon</p>
            </div>
            <p>Liberating Your Mind , can be the second step you take to attract what you have desired in your life.</p>
			<p>I've always wanted to study outside the country for my tertiary studies, while I was still in high school.But due to low self-esteem have always though was not smart enough to get funding as the funding would be most likely be allocated to the brightest students in the country</p>
			<p>I applied to universities in my home countries and got accepted to one that was the best in the whole ocntinent situated in my home country, South Africa. I thought I should be happy since it was ranked the highest in the whole continent, but i wasnt.</p>
			<p>I had settled because of what I have assimilated because its still the bes university . Three years down the line I fall into a very depressive state, and I have to deregister as my mental was in the negatives. </p>
			<p>the begining of the Fourth year I started the year on a bad note but I channelled my mind to think positively , I affirmed myself that I would travel outside my home country ,but dont know how yet.</p>
			<p>By just declaring that I got a scholarship to study out the country, a dream coming true , a dream i had when i was still in high school coming true, by just affirming my capabilities. </p>
