            </div>
            <p>The journey of thousand miles start with a single step.The first step of which is to recover your conciousness, how do you that, one might ask?</p>
			<p>The books about divine knowledge passed down by generations before us are in books that most probable have dust on them,sarcastically books buried deep in the libraries, books not ever touched but can be an eye opening exprience once you consume the knowlege in these books </p>
			<p>Like i said before, nothing is new under the sun, generations lived before us where able to cultivate their conciousness without being manipulated by powers at working. Powers that are working twentyfour-seven dumbing us death by forcing information onto us through various inventions that makes it difficult to stimulate your own imagination as the control most of what you consume with your eyes, tvs, cellphone devices, laptops.</p>
			<p>But how do we fight against assimilating this dullness , by recovering our conciousness. By being selective of what we assimilate and being skeptical over everything we assimilate so we are able to stimulate our own imaginations. </p>
