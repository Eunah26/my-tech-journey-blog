              <h2>Its all in the past,it only exists in your mind</h2>
              <p>Becoming Uncommon</p>
            </div>
            <p>We often love to reminsce and sometimes hold ourselves captive in our pasts.We love to victimize and judge ourselves about past events.Sweetie your past is nothing but your virtual reality playing on repeat </p>
            <p>The past no longer exist, it is no longer the truth because its non-existential in the present momemt.It only resides in your mind , you are the one making it to become alive by putting it on repeat in your mind</p>
			<p>Trust me when I say that you are most likely repeating the scenes wrongly, its like putting a CD on repeat for long time it will probably have scratches, right? that what happens in your mind when you replay the events a lot in your mind </p>
			<p>High probabilty that everyone who was involved in a past situation you were an accomplice of , remembers the situation the way they want to remember it as every mind is not programmed with the same knowlegde and perceives events independently</p>
			<p>Anything traumatic, or bad that has happened to you in the past is not true in the presnt momemt and because you are still breathing air, you have literally survived it and healed physically from it.</p>
			<p>It is only yourself who torments yourself with the memory of it and your ego is not letting you to be emotionally and spiritually be healed of it, because we tend to love to victimize ourselves so we can attain pity from ourlseves and the other people</p>
			<p>Focusing on the bad is nothing but a punishment to your pysche cause believe no one really cares that deeply. It is time to let go</p>
