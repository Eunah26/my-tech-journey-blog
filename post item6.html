              <p>The Four Agreements</p>
            </div>
            <p>As I started to incorporate the Four agreements into my life, life has been different. It dont mean that I dont face challenges or troubles, what im saying i just perceive evrything in another persepective.</p>
            <p>A perspective that is not a punishment to my psche, I reprogrammed my virtual reality to suit my emotions,to harvest my energy to direct it into acheiving my goals rather dispersing it into things that are of my own creation and are draining.</p>
			<p>I took the paintbrush and started to pain my canvas how I want it to be. We as human are artists, we are storytellers  and our stories are definitely not going be the same as we are created to be no one but ourselves. </p>
			<p>Nothing is new under the sun, everything you are going through or went through has happened but in slightly different way. Following that we can deduce that we share the same struggles and victories, we are be able to engineer our ways the way we want them</p>
			<p>But recovering your conciousness is the first step to be able to stimulate and engineer your life.</p>
			<p>What are the four agreements?The Four agreements are tools one can use to be able to recover ones conciousness and be able to steer their own ship in the direction they want rather than subconciously living under the system</p>
