              <p>Becoming Uncommon</p>
            </div>
            <p>It was after Dec 2021 , when I had just exprienced what i woulld like to remember to be my first heatbreak. By the way would not wish that on anyone. </p>
            <p>My first true unconditional love had just laid his hands on me after, I had just questioned him on our relationship status. Bare in mind me and this guy stayed together for one year with no relationship status but was basicallly living like married couple</p>
			<p>I will not bore you with the details, but after the traumatic exprience I felt so lost, like i have been stripped of my identity. I didnt know who i was outside that attachment. </p>
			<p>I took a quest to help re-discover myself or what I would now describe as recreating myself.I meditated, told myself I would be able to get through this painful experience and be able to be myself once again</p>
			<p> I stumbled upon a book called The Four Agreements:Comapnion book by Don Miguel Ruiz, when i was trying to reconnect myself with my old hobbies in search of myself.I specifically targeted self improvement books</p>
			<p> After the first read , I had never perceive life the same again...the rest is history.</p>
