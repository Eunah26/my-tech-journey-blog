            <p>Once we give meaning to the  symbols we learn while we young , we begin to use them to try and makes sense of everything that happens in our lives , everything we perceive with our human eye.</p>
			<p>You can only describe what you perceive with the knowlegde that you have assimilated thus far.</p>
			<p>We know you have finally mastered a language when you are able to use the symbols to talk to yourself in our head, this is when you learn to think.</p>
			<p>Following that you can agree that you can only describe something that you have only thought of,which firstly you had to think relatively to how you perceive yourself, which is the first step.</p>
			<p>You may not be conciously aware of that, but hence I'm bringing it to light so you aware of it.You cant use words you havent used to describe yourself , to describe something else.Those would be foreign concepts to you. </p>
			<p>What am i trying to say? If you always view yourself as an ugly person you likely will not be able to see the beauty of things you perceive as that would be a foreign concept to you.</p>
			<p>Hence every combination of words is just a journey back to you, and your percerption of another is just a reflection of your perception of yourself </p>
