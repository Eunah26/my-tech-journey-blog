            <p>Be Present.One can only cultivate their conciousness if they are present all the time everywhere.</p>
			<p>Being present means taking care of your thoughts, your words, your actions, your reactions and etc.</p>
			<p>Be selective with what you assimilate and cultivate the impeccability of your word </p>
			<p>To unleash the divine You , you'd need to be concious of the basic thing that makes us alive ,the capability of you to breathe. We are born with so much divine knowlegde , knowlegde that would make us survive this world and help us become what we were born to be.
			Knowledge that would help us to reach our desires and destinys,but this knowledge is cememted under the programmed knowlegde the powers at work are trying to instill in our minds to succeed in manipulating us so we can work and live for the system and their enrichment</p>
