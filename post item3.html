            <p>Reset. Why am I passing this message, why am I telling to to leave the past in the past,why am I. urging all to stop reminscing/</p>
            <p>Like I have mentioned in my earlier blog tha the truth is that all of our knowledge we acquired through assimilation and agreement is programmed knowlege </p>
			<p>knowledge that's about social, religious and moral rules of their culture.
			  We are taught how to be a man or woman according to the society we are born into , we taught how to behave the "right" way in our society which means  how to be a "good" human.</p>
			 <p>We taught how to think,but in total truth we are domesticated the same way that a dog, cat or any animal is domesticated: through a reward system and punishment</p>
			 <p>You are taught how to be YOU. But does that sound right to you, are you not born with divine knowlegde how to be YOU.think about it</p>
			 <p>We cant blame the humans who came before us as they were also domesticated and stripped away the right of chose, the natural right to be themselves as soon as they were born into the system</p>
			 <p>Im sharing this with so you able to reset, able to become aware and are able to chose who you want to be.</p>
